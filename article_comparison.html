    <h1>Article Comparison</h1>

    <p>When it comes to tackling racial bias and violence, different works offer unique and necessary perspectives. <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/02/solving-racial-disparities-in-policing/" style="color:black; font-size:20px"><em>The Harvard Gazette article on solving racial disparities in policing</em></a>, and the book How It Went Down by Kekla Magoon are two such works that address this pressing issue head-on. Today, I will be comparing the two and proving to you why, although they may discuss the same topic, they have different views. While the article and the book both emphasize these issues, the article has a more general view, and talks more about this in the context of policing. However, the book zooms in on how one community is affected and reacts to an act of unlawful violence. This brings me into my next point: the book’s focus on one singular community gives us a unique perspective on racial bias and violence, which is not expanded in the article. Also, both touch on the importance of acknowledging and addressing these pressing issues in society. Next, both the article and the book take into account how black people are the ones who are mainly involved in these acts of unlawful violence. And finally, the article presents a more hopeful outlook for change, whereas the book does not. And that is why the Harvard Gazette article on solving racial disparities in policing and the book How It Went Down by Kekla Magoon are similar in a general view, but in depth, are different.<br></p>
