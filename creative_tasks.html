    <h3>Most Important Character</h3>
    <p>The most important character in the book How It Went Down is open to debate and interpretation. However, the most significant character is Jennica, by multiple reasons. The first is that Jennica’s viewpoint on the incident, and its aftermath, is a vital part of the search for justice and accountability. Her character also serves as a representation of the difficulties and social disparities that Tariq’s neighbourhood of Underhill experienced. Finally, readers are motivated to confront their own prejudices and advantages and take action against injustice by Jeninica’s path of resiliency, bravery, and progress throughout the book. This is why I think Jennica is a vital character in the book How It Went Down by Kekla Magoon.</p>

    <h3>Most Important Quote</h3>
    <p>Kekla Magoon’s book “How It Went Down” is a thought-provoking novel that examines the issues of racism, justice, and identity. The book contains some very important quotes, including, “The truth is always complicated.” This quote highlights the complexity of the events that take place in the book and the challenge of discovering the real story behind them. The characters in the book struggle to understand what occurred when a black teen named Tariq Johnson was shot and killed by a white man throughout the entirety of the book. The quote implies that problems of racism and violence that affect our society in the real world can and will not be solved with simple solutions. Instead, we need to value and hear out other points of view and appreciate subtle differences in everyone’s experiences. In conclusion, the quote, “The truth is always complicated,”  tells us that we need to acknowledge the fact that we cannot solve racial bias and similar issues in a simple manner. Rather, we should be compassionate for others, especially when it comes to matters of race and social justice.</p>
